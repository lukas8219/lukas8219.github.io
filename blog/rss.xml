            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some weeks ago, we had a incident that was caused mainly due to how we delay job execution.
One queue had abnormal behavior during the weekends, which our monitoring systems caught, but we were expecting system to be self-healing and be able to kick through this small hiccup.
Tuesday we noticed something was off with our integration systems - where a code that was running for more than a year stopped working at the same time we rolled it for a new big customer.
I got involved early in the incident due to how often <a href="/blog/2024-03-15/redis/is/more/than/cache/job/delay__en">I touch that component of the backend</a> and we initiated investigation so we could get back to the customer as fast as possible with some good news.
After some hours of investigation we ended up concluding that our long polling mechanism had a hot-loop on a certain queue - which in turn was always retrying delays. The first time this edge case was triggered happened during the weekends where we saw the previous abnormal behavior.
Due to always re-delaying jobs,  the amount of postponed jobs to this queue would never actually drain and thus this component  would eternally get stuck while trying to drain postponed jobs - delaying all the other queues from the platform.
In a quick <code>1/2</code> hour solution we shipped code to stop retrying jobs after more than N retries and unblocking the hot loop.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-the-future">What about the future?<a href="#what-about-the-future" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What about the future?" title="Direct link to What about the future?">​</a></h3><p>All that to say <em>what</em>? What is has to do with Redis?
<a href="/blog/2024-03-15/redis/is/more/than/cache/job/delay__en">As described in this post</a> - the job delaying mechanism lives within Redis where we use a Sorted Set to pull the next job. We fanout to a certain amount in parallel - but we only restart this processing after all possible queue targets were drained up until some upper bound timestamp (being the <code>score</code> in a SortedSet). With this fragility in mind and the upcoming code-freeze of December - I suggested to rewrite this design completely.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-design">Current Design<a href="#current-design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Current Design" title="Direct link to Current Design">​</a></h3><p>Whenever a service requests an postpone - which can be either <code>intentionally</code> - calling the method to postpone it OR <code>unintentionally</code> - due to some <em>IO failure, protocol error or some ephemeral channel churn</em> - the job flows through this <code>DelayedJobsStorage</code> design.
The current <code>production</code> design is a simple Sorted Set from Redis where timestamps are the score and key being the job serialized into string.</p><p>Currently we use a <code>cache.r7g.12xlarge ElastiCache</code> (~300GB 🚨) instance to sustain our load SPIKES - like some infrastructure instabilities or big customers data.
In the other end, there's a separate backend component <code>Scheduler</code> that is responsible for triggering individual jobs at certain interval. This component triggers a service that runs a long-polling logic until the current timestamp.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="delayed-jobs-old-design" src="/assets/images/delayed-jobs-old-design.excalidraw.light-0d36dae811866c62916cf305a7786f14.svg#light" width="1055" height="775" class="img_ev3q">

Redis is now running as a reference-to-data component and only stores entire jobs if they are within the next ~2 seconds.</p><p>The storage rationale happens with a couple considerations:</p><ul><li>How long are we planning to postpone?</li><li>How big (byte size) is this job?</li><li>Is this storage backend rolled out for certain queue OR tenant _id?</li><li>Is this storage available? If not, fall back to Redis</li></ul><p>We also changed the core logic behind the backend service that re-enqueues delayed jobs:</p><ul><li><em>Removed the coupling with Scheduler</em>: <ul><li>Instead of waiting for some schedule job trigger the backend service, it triggers itself given a certain interval.</li></ul></li><li><em>Circuit Breaking</em>:<ul><li>Jobs keeps being re-enqueued up to a certain timeout. Preventing one cycle of starving resources OR locking entire service in some hot-loop.</li></ul></li><li><em>Concurrent Processing with Semaphores</em>:<ul><li>We would always have up to N concurrent processing target queues - decoupled from other executions.</li><li>Speeds up draining time.</li></ul></li><li><em>Better visibility</em>:<ul><li>We implemented proper monitoring such as latencies for each re-enqueue, amount of re-enqueues and failure/successful re-enqueues.</li></ul></li><li>*Horizontally Scale by Controlling the ZPOPMIN:<ul><li>Pop the least score up to an upper-bound timestamp.</li><li>This enables us to have multiple instances running which we were unable in the past due to the Singleton Design we had.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="new-design" src="/assets/images/new-design.excalidraw.light-48d7ce8ca90f97614b1231fc2a44f0a6.svg#light" width="3636" height="1894" class="img_ev3q">

When trying to re-enqueue the job - the abstraction easily understands the protocol as being <code>s3</code>.

Maybe some error which needs a retry - who knows? </p><p>The fact is, delaying/retry is a very frequent requirement into Event Driven Architectures.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zalgo Effect is an term used to describe unexpected outcomes of mixing <code>sync</code> and <code>async</code> javascript code.</p><p>It means - if you mix these two approaches SOMETHING weird will happen.</p><p>It's one of those things you kinda <em>don't understand</em> until you see it in real production systems.</p><h1>So what it has to do with Resource Leakage?</h1><p>One day, our SRE team received a couple PagerDuty alerts claiming our services were restarting and not able to work properly due to <code>Error: No channels left to allocate</code> - ie RabbitMQ connections were maxing out in channel allocation. (For RabbitMQ reference into Channels and Connections)</p><p>It was clear some code was leaking channel creations. No one knew what could potentially be - but God I had studied this <code>Zalgo Effect</code> in <code>NodeJS Design Patterns</code> Book and it clicked me something.</p><h1>How was I so sure the Zalgo was the culprit?</h1><p>The service that was throwing that error was only responsible for fan out a couple messages to a lot of other services - so it was easy as creating a <code>Queue</code> object and running N promises concurrently to publish some message.
Checking the RabbitMQ Management UI showed me that we created N channels for that connection.</p><h1>But why it only happened in some scenarios?</h1><p>That's where the <code>Zalgo Effect</code> pops in.</p><p>Our code was built back in ~2015 - Node 4. The callback style was the mainstream. Our Engineers created the abstraction <code>Queue</code> which dealt with almost 50% of our Event-Driven Architecture by itself and had to make the <code>class</code> style w/ async initializations - not so easily with callbacks.</p><p>So the code assumed the following:</p><ol><li>Assert exchange, queues and necessary resources - via something we could call <code>consumeChannel</code>.<ol><li>The consume channel is created whenever the connection is made.</li></ol></li><li>Our <code>confirmChannel</code> - ie the channel we used to <code>publish</code> events was lazily created - mixing <code>async</code> and <code>sync</code> code.</li></ol><p>So the problem lives in 2).</p><p>Imagine the following:</p><ul><li>We <code>assertConfirmChannel</code><img loading="lazy" alt="old-assert-confirm" src="/assets/images/old-assert-confirm-8a21da4bb68e7ae7f2d355388a8a8a4d.webp" width="995" height="113" class="img_ev3q"><img loading="lazy" alt="old-get-instance" src="/assets/images/old-get-instance-24b7afc5993aeba0f081985202d20afa.webp" width="1050" height="211" class="img_ev3q"></li><li>It check's whether the channel EXISTS or NOT.</li><li>If not, create via <code>PROMISE</code> and return control to EventLoop</li><li>If does, return it</li></ul><p>What happens, if the <code>two concurrent promises</code> reaches the same <code>if</code> without the first promise resolving? We try to create the channel two times and override them - thus keeping channels open but just using only the last one.</p><p>This is where the code was <em>leaking</em> channels.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the problem<a href="#fixing-the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fixing the problem" title="Direct link to Fixing the problem">​</a></h2><p>Well, the fix we <em>actually shipped</em> was simply calling 1 Promise and await it and then fan out the other promises.</p><p>But we made it simple due to risks and since the code is being refactored into a new style.</p><h1>How can I fix If I see something like that?</h1><p>If you want a real solution, here's what the V2 would look like - the idea is to create Promises and assign variables with them, instead of doing <code>await</code> on it. Example as below:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="assert-zalgo" src="/assets/images/assert-zalgo-307baf5abd886e4c3cc7e39d5203e33f.webp" width="853" height="197" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This easily fixes the problem - by setting a variable as promise and checking its existence.</p><p>A more robust style, where you actually need to initialize a couple of resources, you could do something like below</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="get-or-create-client-print" src="/assets/images/get-or-create-client-print-86ec69f70ed8bcf441bbb64549391b1e.webp" width="903" height="741" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol><li>Create a function to execute the entire Promise.</li><li>Set up some reference to it</li><li>If requested the same, just use the same Promise.</li></ol><h1>Ok - but why it fixes the problem?</h1><p>The idea is to make sure - we are running things in a sync manner and just making the promises settled on their timing. We need to think about the synchronous code execution block to reason about our promises usage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

second approach is that we can instantiate the objects in <code>sync</code> contexts and only treat the method calls as <code>async</code>  -  instead of needing to play around some dirty gimmicks to call <code>connect</code> and chain promises - even worse, callbackifying.</p><p><strong>NOTES</strong>: AFAIC from Redis V3^ we have an option <code>legacyMode</code> whenever creating the client which we can keep this lazy nature of Redis - doing client buffering of calls.</p>]]></content:encoded>
